# Gaussian Random Field 
-- (Seen as physical representation of coefficient field)

Random Field (Normal Distribution) -> No relationship
Gaussian Random Field -> Create relationship based on the normal distribution

How to create the relationship? 1. correlation length; 2. correlation strength; 3. how similar the correlation?

Correlations are distance-dependent second cumulant of the random field.
